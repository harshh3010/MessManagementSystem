# Mess Management System Frontend

This is the frontend for mess management system that we create as a part of our major project at MNNIT Allahabad.

The frontend is a simple react app that will be built and served statically from backend.

## Setup

- Launch terminal in `MessManagementSystem/Frontend/mess-management-system-ui/` directory.
- Run the following command to install all required node packages:
  ```
  > npm install
  ```
- To run the app in <i>development</i> mode, use the following commands:
  ```
  > npm run start
  ```
- After you are done making changes, rebuild the react app so that the latest changes are reflected when accessing the app from backend. To build the app, run the following command:
  ```
  > npm run build
  ```
